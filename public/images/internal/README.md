# Internal Images

**Purpose:** Images that originate from internal operations and are NOT automatically public.

These images start here and may be promoted to public status after review.

## Folder Structure

```
/internal/
├── mrv/        → MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification) field photos
├── reports/    → Figures, charts, screenshots from reports
├── projects/   → Project-specific images (Uganda pilot, etc.)
└── README.md   → This file
```

## Workflow

1. **Add images here** when they come from:
   - Field visits / MRV data collection
   - Internal reports and documents
   - Project documentation
   - Stakeholder meetings

2. **Review for public use** — Ask:
   - Does it contain sensitive data?
   - Are people identifiable? Do we have consent?
   - Is it high enough quality for public use?
   - Does it align with brand photography guidelines?

3. **Promote to public** — If approved:
   - Copy to appropriate `/images/` folder (heroes, home, features)
   - Update Asset Library page with new entry
   - Sync to website repo if needed

## Status Tags

When adding to Asset Library page, use:
- `internal` — Portal only, not for public website
- `review` — Needs approval before going public
- `public` — Cleared for website use
