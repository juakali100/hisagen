## Source Tracking

When adding report images, note:
- Source document (report name, version)
- Figure/table number
- Date created
- Data source (if applicable)
- Whether data is sensitive/confidential

## File Formats

- **PNG** — Charts, diagrams, screenshots (lossless)
- **SVG** — Vector graphics if available (scalable)
- **JPEG** — Photos embedded in reports (lossy OK)

## Public Promotion Criteria

Report images can go public if they:
- Don't contain confidential financial projections
- Don't reveal proprietary methodology details
- Are clearly labeled and sourced
- Support the public narrative (impact, methodology, results)
- Have been reviewed for accuracy

## Redaction

If promoting to public with sensitive data:
- Remove specific financial figures
- Anonymize location data if needed
- Replace farmer names with initials/pseudonyms
- Create "public version" with `-public` suffix
