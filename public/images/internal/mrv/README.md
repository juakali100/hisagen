## Metadata to Track

When adding MRV images, note (in Asset Library or separate log):
- Date taken
- Location (district, village if applicable)
- Activity type
- Photographer
- Consent status (if people visible)

## Quality Guidelines

- Minimum 1920x1080 for potential public use
- Clear, well-lit shots (golden hour preferred for field work)
- Include context — show environment, not just close-ups
- Capture methodology — how samples are taken, equipment used

## Public Promotion Criteria

MRV images can go public if they:
- Show methodology/process (builds credibility)
- Feature consenting farmers (with permission)
- Don't reveal sensitive location/financial data
- Meet brand photography guidelines (authentic, grounded, warm)
