## What to Capture

For each project milestone, aim to document:
- Key people involved (with consent)
- Location/context establishing shots
- Activity/process in action
- Outcomes/results where visible
- Signage, branding, official moments

## Public Promotion Criteria

Project images can go public if they:
- Feature consenting individuals
- Don't reveal confidential partner information
- Support the project narrative positively
- Are appropriate quality for public use
- Align with brand photography guidelines

## Partner Sensitivities

⚠️ **Check before publishing:**
- Does partner allow their logo/name in public materials?
- Are there NDA or confidentiality considerations?
- Has the partnership been publicly announced?
- Would the image reflect well on all parties?
