# HISAGEN Funding Lifecycle Alignment (Draft)

Purpose: Map HISAGEN work to the Grant Writing Delivery Methodology phases and highlight gaps,
next steps, and reusable process elements for future client work.

NOTE: In this context, "funding" includes grants, accelerators, venture capital, and strategic
philanthropy. The lifecycle is a delivery framework, not a strict linear process.

---

## Phase 01: Vision / Strategy / Program Design
Status: Light, early inputs from Keir (emails, briefs). Needs deeper alignment.
Evidence so far:
- Early concept direction and partner context (Locus AG, Uganda trials, NARO).
Gaps:
- Clear theory of change, program goals, MEL outline, and multi-year targets.
Next step:
- Dedicated strategy session to formalize the program narrative and outcomes.

## Phase 02: Landscape Scanning and Prospect Mapping
Status: Partial. Reviewed Keir's identified prospects.
Evidence so far:
- Funder Alignment Matrix (first pass, top 6 priority funders).
Gaps:
- Broader landscape scan and a scored prospect pipeline.
Next step:
- Expand scan and score (fit, eligibility, size, competitiveness, timeline).

## Phase 03: Donor and Sponsor Engagement
Status: Sparse.
Evidence so far:
- Noted potential outreach (e.g., MacKenzie Scott positioning).
Gaps:
- Outreach plan, warm intro map, engagement cadence.
Next step:
- Build a relationship plan and decide who approaches which contacts.

## Phase 04: Due Diligence and Eligibility
Status: Early.
Evidence so far:
- v0 proposal gaps signal missing evidence and eligibility questions.
Gaps:
- Compliance matrix, eligibility checks, go/no-go criteria per funder.
Next step:
- Build a light compliance matrix and add explicit go/no-go gates.

## Phase 05: Proposal Development and Submission
Status: Active foundation work.
Evidence so far:
- Concept Note (one-page summary).
- v0 Grant Proposal (10-section base narrative).
- Funder Alignment Matrix (tailoring guidance).
Gaps:
- Logic model, budget narrative, and evidence inserts.
Next step:
- Apply the proposal framework more rigorously using the playbook structure:
  - Executive Summary
  - Statement of Need
  - Project Description
  - MEL
  - Sustainability
  - Conclusion
  - Budget Framework

## Phase 06: Contracting and Handover
Status: Not started.
Notes:
- Prepare award pack template and handover checklist.

## Phase 07: Project Initiation and Grant Setup
Status: Not started.
Notes:
- Define reporting calendar, assign owner, set up budget tracking.

## Phase 08: Delivery Prep and Project Planning
Status: Future.
Notes:
- Align with formal project management method (PRINCE2 or PMP).
- Develop implementation workplan and risk register.

## Phase 09: Implementation and Delivery
Status: Future.
Notes:
- Build standard delivery and monitoring cadence for grant-funded programs.

## Phase 10: Post-Project Follow-up and Reporting
Status: Future.
Notes:
- Reporting templates, outcomes narrative, and renewal positioning.

## Phase 11: Closeout and Reflection
Status: Future.
Notes:
- Closeout checklist, lessons learned, and pipeline refresh.

---

## Current HISAGEN Deliverables and Placement
- Concept Note: Phase 05 (proposal foundation).
- v0 Grant Proposal: Phase 05 (base narrative).
- Funder Alignment Matrix: Phase 02 and Phase 04 (prospect mapping + due diligence).

---

## Recommended Next Build (Repeatable)
1) Strategy workshop to close Phase 01 gaps.
2) Expanded prospect scan + scoring (Phase 02).
3) Compliance matrix + go/no-go gate (Phase 04).
4) Proposal deepening using playbook structure (Phase 05).
5) Define Phase 08-11 delivery standards using a PM framework.
