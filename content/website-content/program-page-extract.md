## Hero Section

**Headline:**
> Making Agricultural Carbon Bankable—At Scale

**Subheadline:**
> The HISAGEN Agri-Carbon Program is a replicable system for turning soil carbon into institutional-grade assets. We operationalize the full value chain—from microbial technology to carbon markets.

**CTAs:**
- Primary: "View Uganda Pilot"
- Secondary: "Learn Our Approach"

## Market Opportunity Stats

| Metric | Label | Detail |
|--------|-------|--------|
| $648M | Market by 2034 | 31.9% CAGR |
| 285% | Soil Carbon Growth | 2024 YoY |
| $15-40 | Per Tonne Premium | vs $4.80 avg |

**Supporting copy:**
> Agricultural carbon is the fastest-growing segment of the voluntary carbon market.

## Program vs Project Distinction

**Program = The How**
> A Program is the replicable operating model—the technology stack, partner ecosystem, methodology, and capital structure that can be deployed across multiple geographies.

**Project = The Where**
> A Project is a specific implementation in a precise location—Uganda first, then Kenya, then regional scale. Each project inherits the Program skeleton.

## Four-Layer Stack (The HISAGEN Stack)

**Section headline:** Four Integrated Layers
**Subhead:** Each layer maps to a specialized partner. Together, they solve the bankability problem.

| Layer | Partner | Role | Deliverables |
|-------|---------|------|--------------|
| 1. Technology | Locus AG / HISAGEN | Soil Science & Data | Rhizolizer® Deployment, Yield Improvement (15-30%), SOC Accumulation |
| 2. Verification | 3Degrees | Digital MRV | Verra VM0042 Methodology, Satellite + AI Monitoring, Institutional Verification |
| 3. Finance | Capital Continuum | Blended Capital | 4-Stage Framework, Risk-Matched Funding, Pilot → Scale Pathway |
| 4. Operations | Deep Six / Local Partners | Implementation | Farmer Aggregation, Extension Services, Community Engagement |

---

## Outcome Targets by Phase

| Phase | Timeline | Targets |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Short-Term** | Year 1-2 | 5,000 hectares under management, 15-30% yield improvement, First Verra VM0042 credits issued |
| **Medium-Term** | Year 3-5 | 50,000+ hectares, 70%+ carbon revenue to farmers, Second geography deployed |
| **Long-Term** | Year 5-10 | 1M+ tCO2e verified annually, Model proven for global replication, Sustainable farmer income stream |

## The Farmer Journey (5 Stages)

**Section headline:** From Soil Health to Dual Income
**Subhead:** Smallholder farmers gain two revenue streams: improved crop yields from healthier soil, plus carbon credit income from the carbon their soil sequesters.

### Stage 1: Soil Health
- **Outcome:** Foundation for everything
- **Detail:** Farmer applies microbial treatment (Rhizolizer®). Soil biology activates, nutrient cycling improves.

### Stage 2: Better Yields
- **Outcome:** Immediate income boost
- **Detail:** Healthier soil → stronger crops → 15-30% more harvest. Farmers see results in the first season.
- **Highlight:** ↑ 15-30% Crop Revenue

### Stage 3: Carbon Building
- **Outcome:** Invisible value accruing
- **Detail:** While crops grow, soil organic carbon accumulates underground. This is the carbon asset being created.

### Stage 4: Verification
- **Outcome:** Carbon becomes credible
- **Detail:** Soil carbon is measured, verified to international standards (Verra VM0042), and converted to certified credits.

### Stage 5: Carbon Revenue
- **Outcome:** Second income stream
- **Detail:** Credits sold to corporate buyers. 70%+ of carbon revenue flows directly to farmers as additional income.
- **Highlight:** + Carbon Income (70%+ to farmer)

## Dual Income Model Summary

**Visual concept:** Two boxes with plus sign and equals

| Stream | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Crop Revenue | ↑ 15-30% from better yields |
| Carbon Revenue | New income stream (70%+ to farmer) |
| **= Dual Income** | Sustainable livelihoods |

---

## Data & Capital Flows

**Data Flows Up:**
> Evidence flows from field to market. Ground-truth MRV at farm level → verification through 3Degrees → disclosure-ready data for corporate buyers.

**Capital Flows Down:**
> Investment flows from institutions to stewards. Capital Continuum matches funding type to project stage → reaches farmers via high-integrity frameworks.

---

## Key Messages for Website

1. **Bankability thesis:** Agricultural carbon is unbankable because MRV costs $30-50+/hectare. HISAGEN solves this with integrated technology + verification.

2. **Full-stack integrator:** HISAGEN coordinates the value chain from soil biology to carbon markets.

3. **Dual value:** Farmers get yield improvement (immediate) + carbon income (ongoing).

4. **Replicable model:** Uganda proves the skeleton, then same stack deploys to Kenya, Rwanda, regional scale.

5. **Institutional grade:** Verra VM0042 verification creates credits that meet corporate disclosure needs.
