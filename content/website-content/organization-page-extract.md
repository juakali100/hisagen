## Founding Principles

### 1. Steward-First
> We believe that for nature-based solutions to be permanent, they must be profitable for the individuals managing the land. Our model prioritizes yield increases and recurring income for producers, from smallholders to large estates.

### 2. Scientific Integrity
> We anchor every carbon claim in rigorous microbial baseline data and verified soil organic carbon (SOC) metrics. We do not shortcut the science of sequestration.

### 3. Radical Transparency
> Through our digital portal and the 'Evidence Vault', we provide our funding partners and stakeholders with a live, unvarnished view of our progress, data, and challenges.
