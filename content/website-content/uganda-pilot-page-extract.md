## Founder Commitment

> Phases 0-2 have been funded through director investment and sweat equity. The NARO trials, regulatory submissions, and entity formation represent significant pre-investment that de-risks the project for future funders.

## Evidence & Credibility Points

**For public site "proof points":**
- NARO partnership (government research body)
- 4 agro-ecological zones tested
- Verra VM0042 methodology (international standard)

## Notes for Website Build

1. **Simplify timeline:** Public doesn't need 8 phases - show 4 key milestones
2. **Hero image:** Need good Uganda field/farmer image
3. **Partner logos:** Need Locus AG, NARO, 3Degrees assets
4. **Tone:** Confident but grounded - show progress without overpromising
5. **CTA options:** Newsletter signup, contact form, or link to full portal
